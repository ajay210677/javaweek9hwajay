/**
 * Write a java program using the following descriptions
 * 1. Create one package with name calculate
 * 2. Create two class with name “Calculator” and “Main”
 * 3. Create four methods with manes “addition”, “subtraction”, “division”,
 * and “multiplication”. All methods are instance method and it doesn’t
 * return anything. But it has two parameters with name “int a” and “int
 * b”. Also each method have System.out.println(). This prints the result.
 * Also create all one more method with name “calculateResult” with
 * three parameter with name int a, int b and char symbol. Write the logic
 * in calculateResult method that when user enter first number and
 * second number and symbol based on symbol it does calculate.
 * 4. Write a “main” method into main class. It has scanner that takes user
 * input. Also write the logic that it ask user to “Enter first Number:”,
 * “Enter second Number:” “Please enter one of symbol +,-,*, /:” if user
 * enter + symbol result like “Addition of 5 and 10 is: 15” and respective
 * for other symbol.
 * 5. With the result it’s also print one more message “Would you like to do
 * more calculation Please enter “Y” or “N” :” (Hint use while loop if user
 * enter Y program asking the user to enter First Number, and if user enter
 * N programme should terminate)
